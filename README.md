# Comicgen

<!-- var introduction -->
We love comics. We badly wanted to create comic strips. But there was one
problem. Some of us can't draw a straight line for nuts.

But why should that stop us from creating comics? So here's a gift to ourselves
and the world &mdash; a **Comic Creator**.

We are sure you'd love the company of our friends [Dee](#?name=dee),
[Dey](#?name=dey), and our other comic friends. Go on & have some fun.

## Fonts

For lettering, you can use comic fonts from
[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Handwriting) or
[Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/search/all-fonts?Classification=Comic).

Some fonts we like are:

| Font                              | Example text                                                         |

## Plugins

You can also use Comicgen using the [plugins](#plugins) below.
(We're planning [more plugins](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/integrate). Your help is welcome!)

### Power BI plugin

The [Comicgen Power BI](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen-powerbi) plugin
lets you control the characters, emotions, poses, etc from data. Happy people
can accompany good news on charts.

![Power BI Plugin example](docs/power-bi-plugin.gif)

<!-- end -->

<!-- var api -->

## File API

The raw SVGs and PNGs are at
[gramener.com/comicgen/](https://gramener.com/comicgen/). Look under:

- [src/characters.json](https://gramener.com/comicgen/src/characters.json) - list of characters.
- [src/files.json](https://gramener.com/comicgen/src/files.json) - list of files for each character
- [svg/](https://unpkg.com/comicgen/svg/) - SVG files for each character
- [png/](https://unpkg.com/comicgen/png/) - PNG files for each character

You can create comics by directly linking to these files.
You can embed these files directly in your plugin.

## JavaScript API

To explicitly run comicgen on a selector, run `comicgen(selector)`. This lets
you dynamically create or change a a character.

Here's an example in jQuery showing how you can create a character dynamically:

```js
// Add the character
$('<g class="new" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="sad" pose="yuhoo"></g>').appendTo('body')
// Call comicgen()
comicgen('.new')
```

![Dynamic character rendered via JS](docs/dee-sad-yuhoo-400-300.png)

You can pass an `options` parameter to `comicgen()` to provide default values.
For example:

```js
$('<g class="new" name="dee" angle="straight"></g>').appendTo('body')
comicgen('.new', {
  name: 'dey',      // Set the default name. <g name="dee"> overrides this
  emotion: 'sad',   // Set the default emotion
  pose: 'yuhoo',    // Set the default pose, etc
  width: 400,
  height: 300
})
```

![Dynamic character rendered via JS, with default options](docs/dee-sad-yuhoo-400-300.png)

To render a continuous character (examples: zoozoo, panda, chini),
```js
// Add the character
$('<g class="new" name="zoozoo" face="0.66" body="0.50" width="500" height="600"></g>').appendTo('body')
// Call comicgen()
comicgen('.new')
```

![Dynamic continuous character rendered via JS](docs/dee-sad-yuhoo-400-300.png)

You can pass an `options` parameter to `comicgen()` to provide default values.
For example:

```js
$('<g class="new" name="chini"></g>').appendTo('body')
comicgen('.new', {
  name: 'zoozoo',  // Set the default name. <g name="chini"> overrides this
  face: '0.75',    // Set the face emotion to between meh and surprise (0.75).
  body: '0.50'     // Set the body to exactly intermediate pose between normal and handup (0.50)
})
```

# Vision

We created Comicgen to help people write better stories using comic.

## Our audience are storytellers

Storytellers want to share a message and change their audience. But they worry that their content is not engaging or "catchy" enough to drive the change.

- **Comics are "catchy"**. That makes them a powerful way of engaging the audience.
- **Comics are simple**. Comics are a signal that the content is simple, interesting and often funny. Authors also make comic content simpler, interesting, and funny -- making this a virtuous cycle.
- **Comics drive emotion**. The pictures convey emotions better than just the words alone. They're funny. That helps learning, and makes the stories more memorable.

Anyone who writes an email, a presentation, or a document, is a storyteller.

Within organizations, we see this in:

- **Presenting insights**
  - **Executives' analysis**. An analyst created a poster explaining their work using comic characters. It was simple and engaging -- the entire organization understood this deep learning technique.
  - **Managers' reports**. An admin manager sent his status report as a pair of comic characters conversing. Their CEO read this report fully for the first time.
  - **Consultants' workshops**. A consultant runs a culture workshop using [comics in the presentation](https://www.businessillustrator.com/culture-change-with-comics-workshop/) because "... it's a lot less threatening than an official PowerPoint presentation."
- **Marketing stories**. This could be:
  - **Product teams launching features**. Google Chrome was launched using a [comic book](http://scottmccloud.com/googlechrome/).
  - **Marketer emails**
  - **Event manager invites**

## Comicgen makes storytelling easy

Our vision is to make storytelling with comics easy for everyone. (This includes non-designers, non-programmers, and non-storytellers.)

We do this by:

- [Adding characters](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/characters).
  Characters can be split into layers (like face & body). By combining these cleverly, we can create more characters with fewer drawings.
  If you have a character idea, please [add a comment](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/issues/27).
- [Adding layers](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/layers). We need objects like speech bubbles, panels, headings, objects, scenery, backgrounds etc.
- [Integrate into your workflow](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/integrate). Comicgen should be easy to use in people's current workflow, with their existing tools.
    - Designers use Illustrator / Sketch
    - Developers use HTML / JS
    - Analysts use Tableau /  Power BI
    - Managers use e-mail / MS Office
    - We want to make storytelling easy for everyone
- [API for developers](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/api). Comicgen automates away the drudgery in creating comics. Developers should be able to create any comic without designing, purely using an API
- [UI for non-developers](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/builder). We want users to be able to do this without any programming. This means exposing every feature of the API should be exposed on the UI
- [Teaching](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/teach). The ultimate aim is for people to build better stories. Let's teach them

## We measure success by adoption

We succeed when more people create more and better stories with Comicgen. We measure this by

- How many people have used comicgen
- How many stories have been created using comicgen
- How many characters are present in comicgen. (Variety drives adoption)
- TODO: We need more intermediate success metrics -- things that will drive adoption

<!-- var development -->

## Installation

Load the comicgen library by adding this line in your HTML page's `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://gramener.com/comicgen/dist/comicgen.min.css">
<script async src="https://gramener.com/comicgen/dist/comicgen.min.js"></script>
```

You can use [unpkg.com/comicgen/](https://unpkg.com/comicgen/) instead of
[gramener.com](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) if you wish.

You can also install comicgen locally using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add comicgen     # Recommended option
npm install comicgen  # Alternative, if you prefer npm
```

... and then include:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/comicgen/dist/comicgen.min.css">
<script async src="node_modules/comicgen/dist/comicgen.min.js"></script>
```

Comicgen is tested on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. It does not work on Internet Explorer.


## Embed

To embed a character, add:

```html
<g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smile" pose="thumbsup"></g>
```

This inserts the following image in your HTML.
You can embed it anywhere, including inside an `<svg>` element.

![name=dee angle=straight emotion=smile pose=thumbsup](docs/dee-straight-smile-thumbsup.png)

<a class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://codepen.io/sanand0/pen/YMGMbw">Try it on Codepen</a>

First, you have to choose a character with the `name="<character>"` attribute.
For example:

- `name="dee"`
- `name="dey"`
- `name="humaaans"`
- etc.

Each character has one or more attributes. For example, the characters
`dee` and `dey` use these attributes:

- `angle=`: which angle are they are facing (e.g. `straight`, `side`)
- `emotion=`: what emotion their face expresses (e.g. `sad`, `happy`)
- `pose=`: what pose their body shows (e.g. `pointingup`, `holdinglaptop`)

The character `humaaans` uses these attributes:

- `head=`: what head to use (e.g. `front/afro`, `front/airy`)
- `body=`: what body to use (e.g. `hoodie`, `jacket`)
- `bottom=`: what bottom to use (e.g. `sitting/baggy-pants`, `standing/shorts`)

The list of all valid combinations are available on the
[comicgen interactive gallery](https://gramener.com/comicgen/).

Each character has a pre-defined canvas size. For example, `dee` and `dey` use a
500 x 600 canvas. `humaaans` uses a 300 x 600 canvas. You can change this using:

- `width=`: width of the image in px
- `height=`: height of the image in px

You can also re-position and re-size the canvas using these optional attributes:

- `x=`: left position or x-offset in px
- `y=`: top position or y-offset in px
- `mirror=`: show mirror image. Value can be "" (no mirroring) or "1" (to mirror the image). Default: ""
- `scale=`: how much larger to make the image. Default: 1

The images are rendered as SVG by default. You can use PNGs instead with `ext="png"`:

- `ext=`: choose file format. Value can be `svg` (default) or `png`


## Layer order

The order of attributes decides the order of the layers. For example, this draws
`emotion=` first (at the bottom), and then `pose=` (on top)

```html
<g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="yuhoo" pose="yuhoo"></g>
```

![Dee with emotion below, then pose on top](docs/dee-order-emotion-pose.png)

This draws `pose=` first (at the bottom), and then `emotion=` (on top):

```html
<g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" pose="yuhoo" emotion="yuhoo"></g>
```

![Dee with emotion below, then pose on top](docs/dee-order-pose-emotion.png)

You can re-order the attributes dynamically in the
[comicgen interactive gallery](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) using the arrows.

![Reorder comicgen attributes](docs/reorder.gif)


## Composition

To combine multiple characters in a panel, embed them in an `<svg>` element.

You can change the `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `mirror` and `scale` to position each character.

```html
<svg width="500" height="600">
  <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="pointingright" x="-120"></g>
  <g class="comicgen" name="dey" angle="straight" emotion="smile" pose="handsinpocket" x="150"></g>
</svg>
```

![Dee and Dey together](docs/dee-and-dey-together.png)

<a class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://codepen.io/sanand0/pen/eqYmer">Try it on Codepen</a>


You can resize the combined image by changing the `width` and `height` of the
SVG container.

```html
<svg width="300" height="200" viewBox="0 0 500 600">
  <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="pointingright" x="-120"></g>
  <g class="comicgen" name="dey" angle="straight" emotion="smile" pose="handsinpocket" x="150"></g>
</svg>
```

Set `viewBox` to the width and height of the comicgen elements. Then you can set
the outer `width` and `height` to anything.

![Dee and Dey scaled down](docs/dee-and-dey-meet.png)

This normally scales the image to fit both the width and height. To fit only one
side, use [preserveAspectRatio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio).
For example, `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMin slice"` in this case fits to width
and slices the height, preserving the top (YMin) of the image.

```html
<svg width="300" height="200" viewBox="0 0 500 600" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMin slice">
  <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="pointingright" x="-120"></g>
  <g class="comicgen" name="dey" angle="straight" emotion="smile" pose="handsinpocket" x="150"></g>
</svg>
```

![Dee and Dey fit width](docs/dee-and-dey-slice.png)

## Panels

[comicgen.css](https://gramener.com/comicgen/dist/comicgen.min.css)
provides 2 classes for layout:

- `comic-panel`
- `comic-row`

Use `class="comic-panel"` to can embed characters in a thick grey border. For example

```html
<div class="comic-panel">
  <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded"
    x="-320" y="-120" scale="2.2" width="200" height="200"></g>
</div>
```

![Dee in a panel](docs/dee-panel.png)

Panels are typically placed inside a `class="comic-row"`:

Here's an example with 2 panels. The second panel has 2 characters.

```html
<div class="comic-row">
  <div class="comic-panel" style="margin-right: 10px">
    <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded"
      x="-320" y="-120" scale="2.2" width="200" height="200"></g>
  </div>
  <div class="comic-panel">
    <svg width="200" height="200">
      <g class="comicgen" name="dey" angle="straight" emotion="smile" pose="handsinpocket"
        x="-200" y="-120" scale="2.2" width="200" height="200"></g>
      <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded"
        x="-250" y="-120" scale="1.4" width="200" height="200"></g>
    </svg>
  </div>
</div>
```

![Dee and Dey in panels](docs/dee-and-dey-panels.png)

<a class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://codepen.io/sanand0/pen/ZgEYvx">Try it on Codepen</a>

You can override the panel's background, border width and color using CSS
variables in your stylesheet.

```css
:root {
  --comic-background: #eee;     /* Light grey background. Default: transparent */
  --comic-border-color: #ccc;   /* Light grey border. Default: grey */
  --comic-border-width: 1px;    /* Thin border. Default 2px */
}
```

![Dee and Dey in panels, with CSS styling](docs/dee-and-dey-panels-styled.png)


## Captions

[comicgen.css](https://gramener.com/comicgen/dist/comicgen.min.css)
provides `comic-caption-top` and `comic-caption-bottom` to add captions inside
a `.comic-panel`.

For example, this defines a caption on top:

```html
<div class="comic-panel">
  <div class="comic-caption-top">Hi! I'm Dee.</div>
  <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded" x="-317" y="-119" scale="2.2" width="150" height="200"></g>
</div>
```

![Dee with a caption on top](docs/dee-caption-top.png)

<a class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://codepen.io/sanand0/pen/XvWJEP">Try it on Codepen</a>

... or the bottom:

```html
<div class="comic-panel">
  <div class="comic-caption-bottom">Hi! I'm Dee.</div>
  <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded" x="-317" y="-119" scale="2.2" width="150" height="200"></g>
</div>
```

You can override the caption's background, font and padding using CSS variables
in your stylesheet.

```css
:root {
  --comic-caption-background: #eee;         /* Light grey background. Default: white */
  --comic-caption-font: Neucha, cursive;    /* Custom Google font. Default: cursive */
  --comic-caption-padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;  /* Custom margin. Default: 0.25rem */
}
.comic-caption-top, .comic-caption-bottom { /* Apply any custom styles you want */
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

## Strips

You can combine [captions](#captions) with [panels](#panels) to create a strip
like this:

```html
<div class="comic-row">
  <div class="comic-panel">
    <div class="comic-caption-top">Hi! I'm Dee.</div>
    <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded" x="-317" y="-119" scale="2.2" width="150" height="200"></g>
  </div>
  <div class="comic-panel">
    <div class="comic-caption-top">I'm in a comic strip called Dee & Dey.</div>
    <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="handsfolded" x="-150" y="10" scale="1.5" width="150" height="200" mirror="1"></g>
  </div>
  <div class="comic-panel">
    <div class="comic-caption-top">And this is Dey, my co-star on this strip.</div>
    <svg width="300" height="200">
      <g class="comicgen" name="dee" angle="straight" emotion="smilehappy" pose="pointingright" x="160" y="0" scale="0.88" width="300" height="200" mirror="1"></g>
      <g class="comicgen" name="dey" angle="straight" emotion="smile" pose="handsinpocket" x="-120" y="10" scale="0.88" width="300" height="200"></g>
    </svg>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Add new characters

To add a new character, or add images for an existing character:

1. Add the SVG images under `svg/<character>/<attr>/.../<file>.svg`
2. File or folder names must use only lowercase letters
    - Avoid numbers or special characters
3. Create PNGs and compress the characters: `npm run build-png`
    - This requires [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/). Install it
    - To regenerate a character, remove its PNG folder first. e.g. `rm -rf png/dee/ && npm run build-png`
4. Update [src/characters.json](src/characters.json)
    - Add new character specs under `namemap` and `formats` using the instructions there
5. Update [src/files.json](src/files.json) to add new files
    - This is organized as `{character: {attr: [file, file, ...]}}`
    - We maintain the characters alphabetically (e.g. `dee` appears before `dey`)
6. Update the [character credits](#character-credits)
7. Run `npm run build` to recompile files under `dist/`
8. Run a HTTP server on the comicgen folder and test the character

## Help wanted (developers)

If you're a developer, we'd love your help in improving comicgen.

1. **Report bugs**. If something doesn't work the way you expect, please [add an issue](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/issues)
2. **Ask for features**. Go through the [issues](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/issues). Add a [Like reaction](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-conversations-on-github#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments) to what you like. Or add an issue asking for what you want.
3. **Offer help**. Go through these issues. Pick something interesting. Add a comment saying "I'd like to help." We'll revert in 2-4 days with ideas.

There are 3 areas we're focusing on. Help in these areas would be ideal.

### 1. Integrate comicgen into platforms

People like to use their own platforms, not switch to a new one. So let's integrate comicgen into popular platforms like Excel, PowerPoint, Power BI, Tableau, R, etc as plugins.

[See **integration** issues related &raquo;](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/integrate)

### 2. Create a comic builder UI

People find it easier to create comics using a UI than programming. So let's create an [interface](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) that let people create an entire graphic novel!

[See **builder** issues &raquo;](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/builder)

### 3. Improving comicgen API

Developers access comicgen through a JS library. What can we do to make it easier, and feature rich?

[See **API** issues &raquo;](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/api)

## Help wanted (designers)

Designers, we'd love your help in improving comicgen.

If you're a designer, you could help by:

1. **Designing new characters**. Comicgen characters are open for everyone to use. We [credit the authors](#credits). You can work [freelance](#freelancing) with us, and get paid per character. You can pick your own character, or choose from the [characters people are looking for](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/characters).
2. **Adding new layers**. Apart from characters, we need other "layers" -- things we can add to panel, like speech bubbles, background objects, etc. You can design new kinds of objects if you think people will use it. Here are some [layers people have asked for](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/labels/layers).

Here's a guide to help understand how to design and submit new characters or layers.

### Add new characters

Characters are made of 1 or more SVG images.

The easiest way to create a character is to draw a dozen SVGs and save them as
individual files **of the same dimensions**. For example:

![Series of SVG images for a character](docs/character-single-images.png)

A better way would be to break up the character into different parts. For
example, you could draw faces with different emotions and save them under an
`faces/` folder:

![Faces for a character](docs/character-faces.png)

Then you could draw the bodies under a `bodies/` folder:

![Bodies for a character](docs/character-bodies.png)

If you do this, you must make sure that:

- All faces have the **same dimensions**, and are at the **same position** within the SVG
- All bodies have the **same dimensions**, and are at the **same position** within the SVG
- When you super-impose any face on any body, the **images should align**.

You can choose to break up the images in any number of ways. For example:

- `faces/`, `bodies/`
- `face/`, `trunk/`, `leg/`, `shoes/`
- `hair/`, `face/`, `eyes/`, `mouth/`, `trunk/`, `legs/`

The more combinations you have, the more complex your image becomes. You could
start small and then add variety.

### Submit new characters

Give your character a name (e.g. "Ant Man"). Save the SVG files under a folder
with the character name (e.g. "ant-man" - lower-case, use hyphens as separator).
Add this folder under the
[svg/](https://github.com/gramener/comicgen/tree/master/svg/) folder.

Then [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
or email S Anand <s.anand@gramener.com>.

When doing this, please mention one of the following:

- "I release these images under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) license", OR
- "I release these images under the [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license"


### Freelancing

Comicgen is free, but their designers' time is not. We pay the designers in our team, and freelancers, for the characters they design.

Please e-mail Anand <s.anand@gramener.com> and Richie <richie.lionell@gramener.com> if you can design characters as a freelancer. We'd love your help.
